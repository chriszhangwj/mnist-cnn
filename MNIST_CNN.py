# Intro to CNN

# CNNs apply a series of filters to the raw pixel data of an image to extract and
# learn high level features, which the model can then use for classification.

# It contains three components:

# Convolutional layers, which apply a specified number of convlution filters to the
# image. For each subregion, the layer performs a set of mathematical operations to
# produce a single value in the output feature map.
# Convolutional layers then typically apply a ReLU activation function to the output
# to introduce nonlinearities into the model

# Pooling layers, which downsample the image data extracted by the convolutional layers
# to reduce the dimensionality of the feature map, in order to decrease processing time.
# A commonly used pooling algorithm is max pooling, which extracts subregions of the
# feature map (e.g. 2*2-pixel tiles), keep their max value, and discard all other values.

# Dense layers (fully connected layers), whcih perform classification on the features
# extracted by the convolutional layers and downsampled by the pooling layers. In a dense
# layer, every node in the layer is connected to every node in the preceding layer.

# Typically, a CNN is composed of a stack of convolutional modules that perform feature
# extraction. Each module consists of a convolutional layer followed by a pooling layer.
# The last convolutional module is followed by one or more dense layers that perform
# classification. The final dense layer in a CNN contains a single node for each target
# class in the model (all the possible classes the model may predict), with a softmax
# activation function to generate a value between 0-1 for each node (the sum of all these
# softmax values is equal to 1). We can interpret the softmax values for a given image as
# relative measurements of how likely it is that the image falls into each target class.


# Building the CNN MNIST Classifier

# CNN architecture:
# 1. Convolutional Layer #1: Applies 32 5x5 filters (extracting 5x5-pixel subregions),
# with ReLU activation function
# 2. Pooling Layer #1: Performs max pooling with a 2x2 filter and stride of 2 (which
# specifies that pooled regions do not overlap)
# 3. Convolutional Layer #2: Applies 64 5x5 filters, with ReLU activation function
# 4. Pooling Layer #2: Again, performs max pooling with a 2x2 filter and stride of 2
# 5. Dense Layer #1: 1,024 neurons, with dropout regularization rate of 0.4 (probability
#  of 0.4 that any given element will be dropped during training)
# 6. Dense Layer #2 (Logits Layer): 10 neurons, one for each digit target class (0â€“9)


# tf.layers module
# contains methods to create each of the three layer types above
# conv2d(): constructs a 2d convolutional payer.
# max_pooling2d(): constructs a 2d pooling layer using max-pooling algorithm
# dense(): constructs a dense layer
# Each of these methods accept a tensor as input and returns a transformed tensor as output
# This makes it easy to connect one layer to another: just take the output from  one layer-
# creation method and supply it as input to another


# Note: training CNNs is quite computationally intensive. To train more quickly, decrease
# the number of steps passed to train(), but this will affect accuracy
